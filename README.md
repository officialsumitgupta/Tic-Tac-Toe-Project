# Projects
This Tic Tac Toe project is built using React to create a simple, interactive version of the classic game. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players alternate turns, aiming to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). It utilizes React's component-based architecture, with hooks like useState and useEffect for managing game state and player turns. The project also includes win detection, a reset feature for starting new games, and basic styling with CSS. It's a great introduction to React concepts and is ideal for developers looking to practice building dynamic user interfaces.
